Three standard chemical/industrial processes with clear CO₂ emission sources. These are widely :
a. Cement Manufacturing
Primary emission sources:
Calcination reaction
CaCO3 - CaO + CO2
 (process emissions — unavoidable)
Fuel combustion in kilns (coal, petcoke, gas)
Key variables: Kiln temperature, Fuel consumption, Clinker production rate, Limestone feed rate

b. Iron & Steel Production (Blast Furnace Route)
Primary emission sources:
Coke combustion for heat
Chemical reduction of iron ore using carbon monoxide
Key variables: Coke consumption, Iron ore input, Furnace temperature, Hot metal output

c. Ammonia Production (Haber–Bosch Process)
Primary emission sources:
Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)
 CH4 + H2O - CO + 3H2
Water-gas shift reaction producing CO₂
Key variables: Natural gas consumption, Reforming temperature, Hydrogen yield, Ammonia output
