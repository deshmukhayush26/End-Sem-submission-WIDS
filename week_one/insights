Week 1 tasks 

1. Background: Greenhouse Gases and Climate Change
 Greenhouse gases (GHGs) play a crucial role in regulating Earth’s temperature. However, anthropogenic emissions have significantly altered their natural balance, leading to global warming and climate change. Major Greenhouse Gases: 

Carbon Dioxide (CO2) – Contributes roughly 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Its primary sources include fossil fuel combustion, industrial processes, deforestation, and biological respiration. CO2 is naturally sequestered through the biological carbon cycle via plants.  
Methane (CH4) – Accounts for approximately 11% of emissions. Major sources include livestock, agricultural practices, fossil fuel transport, and decomposition of organic waste in landfills. • Nitrous Oxide (N2O) – Makes up around 6% of emissions, largely originating from agricultural soil management, fossil fuel combustion, and wastewater treatment. 
Fluorinated Gases – Though only about 3%, these gases have very high global warming potential. They are used in refrigeration, air conditioning, and industrial applications.

2. Emission Measurement and Inventories 

Greenhouse gas concentrations are measured in parts per million (ppm) or parts per trillion (ppt). Due to their long atmospheric lifetimes, these gases become well-mixed globally, making their impact widespread. 
The concept of Global Warming Potential (GWP) allows comparison between gases by quantifying how much heat a given gas traps relative to CO2 over a standard 100-year period. An Emission Inventory is a systematic accounting of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere over a specific region and time period. These inventories are essential for climate modeling and policy making. 
High-quality inventories must be complete, consistent, transparent, comparable, and accurate. They are used by governments and scientists to track progress toward emission reduction targets.

3. Process Data Analytics 
Process data analytics is the analysis of data generated by industrial or chemical processes to: Understand behavior, Improve efficiency, Reduce emissions, Detect anomalies

Three standard chemical/industrial processes with clear CO₂ emission sources. These are widely :
a. Cement Manufacturing
Primary emission sources:
Calcination reaction
CaCO3 - CaO + CO2
 (process emissions — unavoidable)
Fuel combustion in kilns (coal, petcoke, gas)
Key variables: Kiln temperature, Fuel consumption, Clinker production rate, Limestone feed rate

b. Iron & Steel Production (Blast Furnace Route)
Primary emission sources:
Coke combustion for heat
Chemical reduction of iron ore using carbon monoxide
Key variables: Coke consumption, Iron ore input, Furnace temperature, Hot metal output

c. Ammonia Production (Haber–Bosch Process)
Primary emission sources:
Steam Methane Reforming (SMR)
 CH4 + H2O - CO + 3H2
Water-gas shift reaction producing CO₂
Key variables: Natural gas consumption, Reforming temperature, Hydrogen yield, Ammonia output
