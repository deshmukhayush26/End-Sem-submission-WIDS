Greenhouse gases -  
1. CO2 - 80%
Sources - fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, oil), solid waste, trees, biological process
Sequestered through biological carbon cycle of plants
2. CH4 - 11%
Sources - transport of coal, natural gas, oil, livestock, agricultural practices, land use, decay in landfills 
3. N2O - 6%
Sources - Agricultural use, combustion of fossil fuels, treatment of wastewater
4. Fluorinated gases - 3% 
HFCs (Hydrofluorocarbons), PFCs (perfluorocarbons), NF3, SF6 produced via variety of household, commercial and industrial applications
Concentration 
- measured in ppm, or ppt.
- 1 ppm ~ one drop of water diluted into about 49 litre/13 gallons liquid ~ fuel tank of a car
- Gases remain in the atmosphere for about a few years to a few thousand years, making it long enough for them to become well mixed, meaning the concentration is roughly same across the world, regardless of source of emissions

GWP (global warming potential) - developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases
I.e. how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time over ~100 years, relative to emissions of 1 ton of CO2
Million metric tons ~ 2.2 billion pounds ~ a million small cars

Emission Inventory 
Accounting of amount of pollutants discharged into the atmosphere 
Contains total emissions for one or more greenhouse gas/pollutant from all source categories, in a specific geographical area, within a specified time period (usually a year)
It is characterized by 
Why - types of activities which case emissions
What - physical identity and quantity of pollutants
Where - area
When - time period
How - methodology

Used by policy makers and scientists for tracking progress towards emission reduction targets and make air quality models
The quality of emission inventories is governed by the factors 
Complete - Covers all sources and pollutants
Consistent - Should be the same across a long time period, using same methods
Transparent - Assumptions and methods should be well stated
Comparable - Estimates reported by parties should be comparable amongst each other
Accurate - estimates should be accurate and uncertainties should be reduced as far as practicable

Tools
Tools can be 
Cross sector - applicable to many industries/business regardless of sector
Country specific - Customized for particular developing countries
Sector specific - Principally designed for specific sectors
Countries and cities - Help them track progress towards their climate goals
